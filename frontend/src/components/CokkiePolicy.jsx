            WHAT ARE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Cookies are small pieces of text stored by a website/ mobile application you visit
            in your browser and subsequently sent by your web browser in every request to
            the website/ mobile application. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and
            allows the Site or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier
            and the Site more useful to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cookies allow DIVYANSH GLOBAL RO. to serve you better and more efficiently, and
            to personalize your experience on our Site. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be
            used in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits,
            understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has
            been opened and acted upon.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie helps us
            recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to website or
            interact with our services without signing in again.
          </p>

          <p>
            The other tracking technologies work similarly to cookies and place small data
            files on your devices or monitor your activity to enable us to collect information.
